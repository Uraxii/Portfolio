--- Description ---

This is a demo for a developer cool I created to more quickly create unique patterns for enemies to shoot. The program is a demonstration of some of the patterns that can be made by modifying the parameters of the script.

--- HOW TO RUN ---
1. Download the files found in this 'Bullet Hell Patterns' directory
2. Run 'Horizon.exe'
3. To exit, use Alt+F4 or alt tab and exit the program by howeving over the icon on the task bar and select the X (close) option.
